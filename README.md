Tool to help gather basic sports event data (e.g. when goals were scored and by whom) from recordings on YouTube, but can be used to record timestamps for whatever you want.
Also let's you zoom and pan smoothly during playback, useful when video was recorded from afar and without a camera operator.

Tip: Fullscreen your browser instead of the video in order to see overlays and use the camera features.
Tip: Delete the squad list in the config box if you don't need to associate people with timestamps, or press 0 to select no one.<br>
Tip: Specify a key with no corresponding event name if you want to record timestamps only (e.g. "g" instead of "g, goal").

Come on Kitties FC!
