# kittiestats

A Tool to help gather basic sports event data (e.g. when goals were scored and by whom) from recordings on YouTube, although it could be used to record timestamps for whatever you want.
You can also zoom and pan smoothly during playback, which is useful for reviewing footage that was recorded from afar with a static camera.

Tips
- After modifying the YouTube URL in the config box to pick a different video, the page URL will update such that you can share a link to kittiestats configured for the chosen video. Note that squad and event configuration are not saved.
- Delete the squad list in the config box if you don't need to associate people with timestamps, or press 0 to select no one.<br>
- Specify a key with no corresponding event name if you want to record timestamps only (e.g. "g" instead of "g, goal").
