# footstamper
A tool for reviewing sports footage.

Features
- Smoothly zoom and pan while watching footage recorded without a camera operator. Useful after you leave a wide angle camera on a tripod on the side of a large field.
- Record timestamps of match events, for instance when goals were scored and by whom. You could also record timestamps for whatever you like.
- Jump between timestamps with hotkeys. Useful for creating highlight reels; Use a screen recorder such as OBS while you zoom/pan and jump between timestamps of match highlights.
- Supports Youtube and local videos.
  
Tips
- Modify the YouTube URL in the config box to pick a different video. The page URL will update to point to FootStamper playing your video of choice.
- Delete the "Squad" list in the config box if you don't need to associate players with timestamps. You can also press 0 to select nobody, then record a timestamp without an associated player.
- In the "Events" section of the config box, specify a key with no corresponding event name if you want to record unnamed timestamps (e.g. "g" instead of "g, goal").
